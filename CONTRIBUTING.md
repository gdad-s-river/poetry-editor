If you find this exciting and would want to help me out, just shoot me a DM on twitter at [@gdad_s_river](https://twitter.com/gdad_s_river) and we could start working! This project is init-ed using *Create React App* and uses draftjs as its editor framework. I can help you out if you want to start with either of them. If you are more experienced than I'm (you know how to write unit tests with jest, use advanced React Component Patterns, set up automated deployment as soon as code is committed to master branch and the like) please feel free to guide me if you have time. I'd really appreciate it
